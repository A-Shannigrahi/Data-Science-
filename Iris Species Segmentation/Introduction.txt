 The project make use of Unsupervised Machine Learning.
 Cluster analysis is widely used in the business field.
 It can used for Consumer Analytics and Market Segmentation.
 In case of Iris Dataset we deal with Species Segmentation based on similarity of features.
 There is no targets given in Unsupervised Machine Learning.
 Instead we divide the dataset in groups(clusters)
 Popular Methods involved are K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
