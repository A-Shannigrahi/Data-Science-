Title-Stock Market Analytics.

Model-Deep Learning( Recurrent Neural Networks).

Case-Predicting the stock prices using the markets trends of previous ten years.

Description-It is almost impossible to accurately predict stock prices using any model.
            No model can take account for sudden  disruptions.
            However it can be predicted to certain extents using powerful deep learning models.
            Deep learning models are based on neural networks and are a subset of machine learning.
            Recurrent Neural Network is an example of supervised Deep Learning .
            LSTM is being used to prevent gradient vanishing problem.
